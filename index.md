### Blog Introduction
Ah blogging - the on again, off again way to dump my thoughts. Twitter was cool for a while - microblogging it once was called. I just can't stand typing in one thread after another, though. I once worked hard at my blog for work over at <a href="http://gabe19.blogspot.com" target="_blank">blogspot</a>. I created this site as fresh start, but it too now needs a fresh set of posts.

My posts are almost always practical exlpanations of what I do every day which is always either something technical or the management of people and process around the same. 

I don't tweet anymore, but if you are on a historical excavation, check out <a href="https://twitter.com/jeffgabriel" class="twitter-follow-button" data-show-count="false">Twitter feed</a><script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I currently work as the head of Engineering for <a href="http://contentful.com" target="_blank">Contentful</a> where we build the best AI-infused digital experiences platform.

You can see more about who I am and have been professionally over on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeff-gabriel-88395b" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>.
