### Blog Introduction
I started this new blog as it has been a long time since I maintained my work over at <a href="http://gabe19.blogspot.com" target="_blank">blogspot</a> and so many things have changed that it just seemed like time for a fresh start.

My posts are almost always practical exlpanations of what I do every day which is always either something technical or the management of people and process around the same. 

I occassionally tweet mostly non-technical stuff.

I work for an incredibly exciting startup called <a href="http://www.nexosis.com" target="_blank">Nexosis</a> where we build software to enable more developers to use Machine Learning.

You can see more about who I am and have been professionally over on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeff-gabriel-88395b" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>.
